The Private Internet of Things Manifesto
=====

We believe the Internet of Things is a very promising idea, but we notice it brings very serious privacy concerns. A lot of sensitive data from various sensors around us is going to be gathered and processed in centralized data stores run by big corporations and governments. We think it does not need to be so. We are proposing the Private Internet of Things (PrIoT) paradigm, where private data is stored in decentralized private clouds, fully controlled by users, interoperable with other private clouds and in federation with them, using open standards.

Similar to [federated social networks](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2011/03/introduction-distributed-social-network(https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2011/03/introduction-distributed-social-network), the PrIoT model gives control over sensitive data back to users. They decide which data will be exchanged using one of the emerging open protocols:
- [Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP)](http://amqp.org/) by OASIS,
- [Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)](http://coap.technology/) by IETF,
- [Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT)](http://mqtt.org/) by OASIS,
- [Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP)](http://xmpp.org/) by XSF.

This could be achieved by deploying a local PrIoT cloud based on open source projects like:
 - [AllJoyn](http://www.alljoyn.org/) by AllSeen Alliance,
 - [Contiki (CoAP)](http://www.contiki-os.org/) by Adam Dunkels et al,
 - [Kaa (MQTT/HTTP)](http://www.kaaproject.org/overview/) by CyberVision,
 - [Open IoT Stack for Java (MQTT)](http://iot.eclipse.org/java/) by Eclipse Foundation,
 - [RabbitMQ (AMQP)](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) by Pivotal,
 - [Spark (CoAP)](http://spark.github.io/) by Spark Labs.
