The Private Internet of Things Manifesto
=====

We believe the Internet of Things is a very promising idea, but we notice it brings very serious privacy concerns. A lot of sensitive data from various sensors around us is going to be gathered and processed in centralized data stores run by third-party corporations and governments. We think it does not need to be so. We are proposing the Private Internet of Things paradigm, where private data is stored in decentralized private clouds, fully controlled by us, interoperable with other private clouds and in federation with them, using open standards.
